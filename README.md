# House-price-prediction (House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques)

Today we are going to work on a dataset which consists information about the location of the house , price and other aspects such as square feet etc. When we work on these sort of data , we need to see which column is important for us and which is not. Our main aim today is to make a model which can give us a good prediction on the price of the house based on other variables. We are going to use Linear Regression for this dataset and see if it gives us a good accuracy or not.

What is good accuracy ? Well , it depends on what sort of data we are working with , for a credit risk data an accuracy of 80% may not be good enough but for a data using NLP it would be good. So we can’t actually define “good accuracy” but anything above 85% is good. Our aim on this dataset is to achieve an accuracy score of 85%+
# Methodology
 1. Data overview
 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
 3. Cleaning the data: Pre-processing
 4. Extracting features from data
 5. Preparing the data for models
 6. Modeling: Machine Learning Models
 7. Final Solution: Regression using Multi-Layered Perceptrons
 It was fun as well as a great learning experience doing this case study. I thank you for reading this blog  and feww yoytube channels like krish nayak and I hope this has added some value to you. I have included minimal code in this blog. For full code, please refer to the ipython notebooks.
 thanks
